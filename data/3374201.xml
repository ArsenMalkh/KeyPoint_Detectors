		<Aux:document_text xml:lang="en-US">In the same year after the hospital was turned over to the Baptists, they continued running the hospital and the ministries that were already ongoing after the Presbyterians left to focus for their outreach in Eastern Visayas. In 1926, Rose Nicolet retired as superintendent of nurses and principal of the nursing school. Her said held positions were later replaced by Hazel O. Mann, a Canadian missionary nurse with the Baptist Mission, while Flora G. Ernst who came from the American Baptist Mission Society, USA, came as her assistant. It was their exceptional executive ability that the training school for nurses expanded as years went by. No school fees were charged on students during Hazel Mann's principalship while they were given books, uniforms and a nurses obstetrical kit after graduation. By 1929, nursing became an accepted profession. Students no longer had to be forced to join. As many students wanted to become nurses, entrance requirements were imposed. Those who completed high school were preferred. From this time to the 1940s the students paid only 40.00 Philippine peso for their textbooks and for the three-year training period. A new foundation of the Union Mission Hospital was set in 1929. The hospital needed for a new site and a bigger hospital became evident. Dr. Dwight L. Johnson, the Canadian director of the hospital at that time, started a fund campaign to meet this need. The plan gained support from civic-spirited notable Ilonggos in the community of Iloilo like Julian Go and the Lopez family, the hospital and nursing staff, and the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society, which raised an amount needed for the hospital's new site and building. In the same year, the foundation for the 120-bed, concrete hospital was laid in the property the hospital bought at Mission Road in the City of Jaro), a present day district of Iloilo City. Dr. Dwight Johnson was given credit for the planning and construction of Union Mission Hospital's new site and structure</Aux:document_text>
