		<Aux:document_text xml:lang="en-US">At this point, the band was rather exhausted, the recordings had been quite strenuous, and when invited to play at the prestigious By:Larm Festival in Oslo, they needed a break more than the honour, although the shows were pulled through. After a well deserved break which was spent mixing the album, Afenginn went to America again in March. They were invited to play at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas - the biggest and most influential music event worldwide. Back home, they finished up the album during a Denmark tour, before they were invited to play in Malaysia in late April. Afenginn played two shows in the monumental botanic garden in Penang. Afenginn were treated as full blown rock stars, held press conferences, were escorted back and forth to the high class hotel and finished the fabulous trip with a nice and warm holiday at Langkawi, much to the liking of the Scandinavian ensemble. Later that spring, Afenginn were honoured with the biggest grant from the Danish Arts Council's “Young Elite” program, giving the band 400.000 DKK over two years. This came as a surprise for the band, who had plans of taking a small break and gave a massive shot of new energy. With the responsibility and trust from the Arts Council, as well as the opportunities the money gave them, they decided to keep the engine going, keeping up the momentum. Afenginn's third and most ambitious album - Reptilica Polaris - was released in June worldwide. Once again, the critics were happy, giving the album great reviews. The audiences also embraced the album, which received a Danish Music Award in the category “Best Contemporary Artist”. In September, the complete album was performed live during the Reptilica Polaris release tour in Denmark. This was a big production which, apart from Afenginn, featured five singers, three brass players and an additional man on the bass, while Aske played the guitar.
