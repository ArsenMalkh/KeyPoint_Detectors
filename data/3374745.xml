		<Aux:document_text xml:lang="en-US">Firstly, I should like to say that I am presenting this report on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture, in my capacity as chairman of that committee. The proposal submitted to us by the Commission is, in my view, fundamentally balanced, in that it contains a section devoted to specialized breeders - in other words, producers of suckler cows and young bovines - and another section devoted to the national element, which will enable each Member State to adapt and respond according to its own specific circumstances. I tabled a number of amendments which did not receive the support of the Committee on Agriculture, and which I am now retabling in plenary on my own behalf. These amendments seek to increase the aid to specialized producers to ECU 50 for each animal. What seems essential to me in this debate is to support those specialized farmers and breeders in Scotland, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and France who live from the production of beef and veal alone and whose future depends on this activity, as opposed to other farmers who are undoubtedly affected by the crisis, but who produce beef and veal alongside other activities. I therefore believe that it is important to support these specialized producers, whose animals have never seen an ounce of meat meal in their lives, because they are reared on grass. There are producers of this kind throughout Europe. These are the producers who should be supported in particular, and that is why I am proposing to increase the compensation to ECU 50 for suckler cows and young bovines.  I am also making this proposal in order to send a political signal, because all that people can find to say to me on this subject is: ' The package will be inadequate, and so we shall have to show self-restraint and distribute it as widely as possible' </Aux:document_text>
