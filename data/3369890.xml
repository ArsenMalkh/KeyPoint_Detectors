Paragraph 8 of the Agreement is deleted in its entirety and the following language is substituted in lieu thereof: COT-0469 A “The County will be responsible for all capital projects and costs of the building with all such projects requiring appropriate University and state reviews and approvals, including execution of a Capital Improvement Donation Agreement, and compliance with applicable historical preservation requirements. The duly executed Capital Improvement Donation Agreement is incorporated herein and made a part of this Agreement. It is agreed that the Campus School Building is as of the date of execution of this Agreement hereof in need of several life safety, Americans with Disabilities Act, capital maintenance, and other renovation improvements, which are to be planned, approved and completed as described in the project(s) completion timetable (Exhibit 1) set forth in the Capital Improvement Donation Agreement. “Except as may be required under Paragraph 14 of the Agreement, any future capital improvement projects beyond those identified in the Capital Improvement Donation Agreement shall be initiated only after the mutual agreement of the parties. “Notwithstanding County funding obligations under this Paragraph 8, however, the University agrees to provide a financial match to privately raised funds designated for capital projects at the Campus School in the amount of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) to assist the County in meeting its responsibility for all capital projects costs of the Campus School building. The University’s commitment to provide One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) is contingent upon the County being the recipient of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in private funds specifically earmarked for capital improvement and maintenance projects at the Campus School by no later than April 1, 2008. The parties specifically acknowledge that this is the only contribution of University and/or TBR funds that will be made towards capital projects costs at the Campus School. “County acknowledges that it is responsible for timely completion of the projects outlined in the Capital Donation Agreement, as amended, whether or not University and/or private funds are provided for the projects. The County maintains full responsibility for the timely completion of the projects at all times. “County agrees to initially pay all costs directly associated with the capital projects, including, but not limited to, construction costs, design fees, equipment, testing, and administrative costs. University agrees to reimburse County up to the maximum One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) match upon receipt of documentation of expenditures. County shall utilize its own resources and private contributed funds before requesting reimbursement from University. Requests for reimbursements will be made monthly. University agrees to reimburse County within fifteen (15) days of receipt of documentation.” 2. Paragraph 10 of the Agreement is amended by adding the following language: “Termination shall be effective at the end of the current school year.” C07-0469A 3. Paragraph 11 of the Agreement is amended by adding the following language: “County assumes full responsibility and liability for claims resulting from its failure to meet fire, life safety, Americans with Disabilities Act or any other pertinent laws, codes and rules applicable to the Campus School facilities.” 4. Paragraph 26 of the Agreement is amended by adding the following language: “County assumes full responsibility and liability for claims resulting from its failure to meet fire, life safety, Americans with Disabilities Act or any other pertinent laws, codes and rules applicable to the Campus School facilities.” 5. The following provision is added as Paragraph 32: “County shall maintain documentation for all payments and charges under this Agreement. The books, records and documents of County, insofar as they relate to this Agreement, shall be maintained for a period of three (3) full years from the date of the final payment, and shall be subject to audit, at any reasonable time and upon reasonable notice, by the University or the Comptroller of the Treasury or their duly appointed representatives.” Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Amendment, the above reverenced original Agreement is hereby ratified and confirmed. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have hereunto set their hands by their duly authorized representatives in duplicate, either of which copy may be treated as an original for all purposes, this the day and year first above written. MIDDLE TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY f BY: TITLE: DATE: RUTHERFORD COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION DATE: APPROVED: TE ESSEE BOARD OF REGENTS BY: TITLE: C"LKa.r) (L^lloA DATE: </Aux:document_text>
