		<Aux:document_text xml:lang="en-US">In 1984 the ship's homeport was changed from Helsinki to Mariehamn. On 21 March 1985 while outside Helsinki the ship's rear on top of the heavy sea ice during a turn, as a result of which the ship listed slightly and a truck trailer overturned on a second truck on the cardeck. There were no other casualties and the ship was able to continue sailing normally. There was a more serious threat to the ship made on 17 August 1986 when a bomb threat was made against the ship in Stockholm. The passengers and crew were evacuated, and to ensure passenger safety they were taken to Turku onboard MS Svea instead of sailing to Helsinki as planned. Later the Silvia Regina departed Stockholm without passengers and resumed normal traffic in Helsinki the following day. In January 1987 Johnson Line purchased the Silvia Regina from Suomen Yritysrahoitus with the cost of 189,862,839 Finnish markka, and moved her under Swedish flag. However the following year Johnson Line sold the ship to Stena Line who chartered her back to Johnson Line until Silja Line's new Helsinki–Stockholm ships (then still in planning stages) were completed. In the end the new ships were severely delayed, and it was not until the end of May 1991 that the ship stopped sailing for Silja Line. For the last months of her service with Silja she received Silja Line's new funnel colours, with the blue seal that had up until that point been painted to the side of the ship next to the name moved to the funnel.</Aux:document_text>
