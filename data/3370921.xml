		<Aux:document_text xml:lang="en-US">For Le Van Tra, the technical operations co-ordinator for the Mines Advisory Group (MAG) in Quang Tri, this legacy of war is an everyday fact of life. Le Van has been working for the group for 13 years. He and his colleagues investigate the unexploded bombs located by the group's community liaison teams and work out how to make them safe. If Le Van's knowledge of the ordnance found on the ground in Quang Tri can sometimes appear to border on the psychic, it's because it's had to be. Before working for the mines group, he was one of many people – untrained and uneducated in the workings of unexploded bombs – who trawled the forests and beaches of Quang Tri hunting for the metal casings that could be traded for scrap. It's an activity both illegal and lethal, but for many in the poor and isolated regions of Quang Tri, the 25,000 Vietnamese dong ($1) a shell casing can fetch is tempting. Given the nature of the work, accurate casualty figures are impossible to come by, but they're high. "My wife and family were scared," Le Van explained. "They knew that a lot of scrap metal collectors were being killed, but there was a lot of UXO to be found then and scrap metal collecting, for many, was just another part of farming." But for every piece of ordnance found came the risk of another explosion, and it was with relief as well as pride that Le Van's wife and family greeted his decision to join the mines group.</Aux:document_text>
