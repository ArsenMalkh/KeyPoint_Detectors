		<Aux:document_text xml:lang="en-US">In 1982 Brezhnev died and Rashidov died the following year, opening the door to new investigation of the corruption which had occurred during their leadership. In 1983, Telman Gdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov began investigating what would become known as the Uzbek Cotton Scandal. They discovered records indicating that Herman Karakozov had been convinced of Nasriddinova's involvement and that intervention by Leonid Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Central Committee had stopped her arrest in 1975. Nasriddinova first learned of the investigation when the newspaper Izvestia published an article in 1987. In the article, she was accused of having taken a bribe of ₽100,000 and routing gold to Swiss banks, while she was the Chair of the Uzbek Presidium. Investigative journalist, Arkady Sakhnin, alleged that Nasriddinova also paid for her son’s lavish wedding with state funds, which prompted a scolding from Brezhnev, but no further action against her. In 1988, the accusations Rashidov had made in 1977 resurfaced with formal charges and she was stripped of her party membership and pension. In December 1990, they were dropped citing insufficient evidence against Nasriddinova. In 1991, she was rehabilitated, restored to party membership, and paid the pension for the 2 1/2 years it had been suspended. Nasriddinova insisted she had never been involved, that witnesses had fabricated testimony against her, and demanded that Izvestia print her answer denying all the allegations in their article.</Aux:document_text>
