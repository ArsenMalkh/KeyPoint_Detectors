		<Aux:document_text xml:lang="en-US">He was said to be no more than two days old judging by the umbilical cord remnants that were still present; it was speculated that the male calf was separated from his mother by the flood and thrown onto the road by the rising water levels. After waiting with him for several days for the possibility of his mother returning, the calf was taken into the care of local foresters, who named him "Pubal". Officially Pubal was not supposed to have a name as they are not given to wild animals, but the rangers who raised him and looked after him prior to his departure from the region started calling him "Pubal"; the letters "P" and "U" are reserved for the Białowieża-Caucasus race of the European bison species, while the ending "bal" comes from Nadleśnictwo Baligród or the Baligród Forestry. For nine months, the Baligród forester Witold Szybowski and his wife Urszula looked after the young wisent, initially feeding him milk with a baby bottle. Kompania Piwowarska, the brewing company of the popular Żubr beer brand, donated 2400 złoty to cover some of the growing bison's feeding costs. In April 2006, Pubal was released into the wild near a wisent herd, but he soon lost interest in rejoining his own species and continued to seek out human contact – at one point interrupting the picnic of a family of tourists and frightening them, before the group realised that he was not aggressive and completely tame.</Aux:document_text>
