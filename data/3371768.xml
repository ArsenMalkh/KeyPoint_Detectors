		<Aux:document_text xml:lang="en-US">Small, wide-eyed, mousy, and sad, Marcelline Niyonsenga maintains the posture of an importuning child, looking up anxiously as if waiting for someone’s permission to go on living. She was nineteen when the war began, visiting family in Kigali, and their house was attacked. Shortly thereafter, she found another family with whom to hide. The head of that household, an old man, threw out his wife and forced Marcelline to become his sex slave. After two and a half months, he announced that he was tired of her. She was gang-raped and reluctantly found refuge with another rapist, a businessman who took her with him to Congo. When she learned that the war was over, she begged to go home, but she was pregnant, and her husband had decided to keep her and the child. She waited months for a day when he was away on business. She grabbed three thousand Congolese francs (about $5) and persuaded a taxi driver to take her to Rwanda, where the United Nations High Commission for Refugees took her in. Her damaged uterus had to be removed after the birth of her daughter, whom she named Clémence Tuyisenge.</Aux:document_text>
