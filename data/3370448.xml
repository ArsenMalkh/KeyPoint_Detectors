		<Aux:document_text xml:lang="en-US">Vladimir Sterekhov called on those participating in the Conference to take part as actively as possible over the remainder of the year in the formulation of a portfolio of projects, and expressed his satisfaction with the work in hand: "I consider", he said, "that much has been achieved and not only as concerns projects and jobs, but also as concerns changed attitudes". CNCP Programme reader, Patrick Gray, in his presentation outlined the development of the instruments which the CNCP team used to achieve the aims of the partnership. For example, supporting CNCP contribution: over 1,500,000,000 roubles and some 2,400 jobs for the economies of the Closed Cities the creation of joint ventures involving foreign investors in Closed Cities had turned out to be unrealistic and had had to be dropped. Other initiatives had proved to be highly successful. For example, about eighty small business enterprises had been established in the territories which the Closed City municipal authorities were responsible for and all of the evidence suggested that the great majority of these would continue to develop. At this point, as we approach the final phase of CNCP activities, the need was to work together to re­shape the methods employed by the Partnership. Forms of support which could be used effectively over the next three years to make the outcomes of the Programme even more successful had to be developed.</Aux:document_text>
