The term "gas’1 as used herein includes helium, carbon dioxide, gaseous sulfor compounds, coal bed methane and other commercial gases, as well a normal hydrocarbon gases. In addition to the abovedescribed land, this lease and the term "leased premises" also covers accretions and any small strips or parcels of land now or hereafter owned by Lessor which are contiguous or adjacent to the above-described land, and, in consideration of foe aforementioned cash bonus, Lessor agrees to execute at Lessee's request any additional or supplemental instruments for a more complete or accurate description of the land so covered. For the purpose of determining the amount of any payments based on acreage hereunder, the number of gross acres above specified shall be deemed correct, whether actually more or less. 2. Term of Lease. This lease, which is a "paid-up” lease requiring no rentals, shall be in force for a primary term of Three (3) years from the date hereof, and for as long thereafter as oil or gas or other substances covered hereby are produced in paying quantities from the leased premises or from lands pooled therewith or this lease is otherwise maintained in effect pursuant to the provisions hereof. 3. Royalty Payment Royalties on oil, gas and other substances produced and saved hereunder shall be paid by Lessee to Lessor as follows: (a) For oil and other liquid hydrocarbons separated at Lessee’s separator facilities, the royalty shall be One-Eighth (l/8fo) of such production, to be delivered at Lessee's option to Lessor at the wellhead or to Lessor’s credit at the oil purchaser’s transportation facilities, provided that Lessee shall have the continuing right to sell such production to itself or an affiliate at the wellhead market price then prevailing in the same field (or if there is no such price then prevailing in the same field, then in foe nearest field in which there is such a prevailing price) for production of similar grade and gravity; (b) for gas (including casinghead gas) and all other substances covered hereby, the royalty shall be One-Eighth (l/8fo) of foe proceeds realized by Lessee from foe sale thereof, provided that Lessee shall have the continuing right to sell such production to itself or an affiliate at the prevailing wellhead market price for production of similar quality in the same field (or if there is no such price then prevailing in the same field, then in the nearest field in which there is such a prevailing price) pursuant to comparable purchase arrangements entered into on the same or nearest preceding date as the date on which Lessee or its affiliate commences its purchases hereunder; and (c) in calculating royalties on production hereunder, Lessee may deduct lessor's proportionate part of any ad valorem, production and excise taxes and any costs incurred by Lessee in treating, processing, delivering and otherwise marketing such production. If at the end of foe primary term or any time thereafter one or more wells on the leased premises or lands pooled therewith are capable of producing oil or gas or other substances covered hereby in paying quantities, and all such wells are either shut in or production therefrom is not being sold by Lessee such well or wells shall nevertheless be deemed to be producing in paying quantities for foe purpose of maintaining this lease. A shut-in well shall also include a well or wells drilled on the lease premises or lands pooled therewith which appear to foe Lessee by the electric log to be productive of oil or gas. If for a period of 90 consecutive days such well or wells are shut in or pnxluction therefrom is not being sold or produced by Lessee, then Lessee shall pay an aggregate shut-in royalty of one dollar per acre then covered by this lease, such payment to be made to Lessor on or before the end of said 90-day period and thereafter on or before the end of each anniversary of the expiration of said 90-day period while the well or wells are shut in or production therefrom is not being sold or produced by Lessee; provided that if this lease is otherwise being maintained by operations, or if production is being sold by Lessee from another well or wells on the leased premises or lands pooled therewith, no shut-in royalty shall be due until the end of foe 90-day period next following cessation of such operations or production. Lessee’s failure to properly pay shut-in royalty shall render Lessee liable for the amount due, but shall not operate to terminate this lease. This lease may not be perpetuated by the shut-in payment for any one period exceeding three (3) consecutive years. 4.  Shut-in Payment. Alt shut-in royalty payments under fols lease shall be paid or tendered directly to Lessor at the above address, or its successors, regardless of changes in foe ownership of said land. All payments or tenders may be made in currency, or by check or by draft and such payments or tenders to Lessor by deposit in foe U.S. Mails in a stamped envelope addressed to the Lessor at foe last address known to Lessee shall constitute proper payment 5. Operations. If Lessee drills a well which is incapable of producing in paying quantities (hereinafter called "dry hole") on the leased premises or lands pooled therewith, or if all production (whether or not in paying quantities) permanently ceases from any cause, including a revision of unit boundaries pursuant to foe provisions of Paragraph 6 or foe action of any governmental authority, then in foe event this lease is not otherwise being maintained in force it shall nevertheless remain in force if Lessee commences operations for reworking an existing well or for drilling an additional well or for otherwise obtaining or restoring production on the leased premises or lands pooled therewith within 90 days after completion of operations on such dry hole or within 90 days after such cessation of all production. If at foe end of foe primary term, or at any time thereafter, this lease is not otherwise being maintained in force but Lessee is then engaged in drilling, reworking or any other operations reasonably calculated to obtain or restore production therefrom, this lease shall remain in force so long as any one or more of such operations are prosecuted with no interruption of more than 90 consecutive days, and if any such operations result in foe production of oil or gas or other substances covered hereby, as long thereafter as there is production in paying quantities from the leased premises or lands pooled therewith. After completion of a well capable of producing in paying quantities hereunder, Lessee shaft drill such additional wells on the leased premises or lands pooled therewith as a reasonably prudent operator would drill under the same or similar circumstances to (a) develop the leased premises as to reservoirs then capable of producing in paying quantities on foe leased premises or land pooled therewith, or (b) protect the leased premises from uncompensated drainage by any well or wells located on other lands not pooled therewith. There shall be no covenant to drill exploratory wells or any additional wells except as expressly provided herein. 6. Pooling. Lessee shall have the right, but not foe obligation, to pool all or any part of foe leased premises or interest therein with any other lands or interests, as to any or all depths or zones, and as to any or all substances covered by this lease, either before or after foe commencement of drilling or production whenever Lessee deems it necessary or proper to do so in order to prudently develop or operate the leased premises, whether or not similar pooling authority exists with respect to such other lands or interests. The creation of a unit by such pooling shall be based on the following criteria (hereinafter called "pooling criteria"). A unit for an oil well (other than a horizontal) shall not exceed 40 acres plus a WSH: 033-14-221-01 of 10%: provided that a larger unit may be formed for an oil well or gas well or horizontal completion to conform to any well spacing or density pattern that may be prescribed or permitted by any governmental authority having jurisdiction to do so For the purposes of the forgoing, the terms "oil well" and "gas well" shall have the meanings prescribed by applicable law or the appropriate governmental authority, or if no definition is so prescribed, "oil well" means a well with an initial gas-oil ratio of less than 100,000 cubic feet per barrel and "gas well" means a well with an initial gas-oil ratio of 100,000 cubic feet or more per barrel, based on a 24-hour production test conducted under normal producing conditions using standard lease separator facilities or equivalent testing equipment; and the term "horizontal completion" means an oil or gas well in which the horizontal component of the gross completion interval in the reservoir exceeds the vertical component thereof. In exercising its pooling rights hereunder, Lessee shall file of record a written declaration describing the unit and stating the effective date of pooling. Production, drilling or reworking operations anywhere on a unit which includes all or any part of the leased premises shall be treated as if it were production, drilling or reworking operations on the leased premises, except that the production on which Lessors royalty is calculated shall be that proportion of the total unit production which the net acreage covered by this lease and included in the unit bears to the total gross acreage in the unit, but only to the extent such proportion of unit production is sold by Lessee. In the event a unit is formed hereunder before the unit well is drilled and completed, so that the applicable pooling criteria are not yet known, the unit shall be based on the pooling criteria Lessee expects in good faith to apply upon completion of the well; provided that within a reasonable time after completion of the well the unit shall be revised if necessary to conform to the pooling criteria that actually exists. Pooling in one or more instances shall not exhaust Lessee's pooling rights hereunder and Lessee shall have the recurring right but not the obligation to revise any unit formed hereunder by expansion or contraction or both, either before or after commencement of production, in order to conform to the well spacing or density pattern prescribed or permitted by the governmental authority having jurisdiction, or to conform to any productive acreage determination made by such governmental authority. To revise a unit hereunder, Lessee shall file of record a written declaration describing the revised unit and stating the effective date of revision. To the extent any portion of the leased premises is included in or excluded from the unit by virtue of such revision, the proportion unit production on which royalties are payable hereunder shall thereafter be adjusted accordingly. In the absence of production in paying quantities from a unit, or upon cessation thereof, Lessee may terminate the unit by filing of record a written declaration describing the unit and stating the date of termination. Pooling hereunder shall not constitute a cross-conveyance of interests. 7.  Payment Reductions. If Lessor owns less than the full mineral estate in all or any part of the leased premises, the royalties, and shut-in royalties payable hereunder for any well on any part of the leased premises or land pooled therewith shall be reduced to the proportion that Lessor's interest in such part of the leased premises bears to the full mineral estate in such part of the leased premises. To the extent any royalty or other payment attributable to the mineral estate covered by the lease is payable to someone other than Lessor, such royalty or other payment shall be deducted from the corresponding amount otherwise payable to Lessor hereunder. 8. Ownership Changes. The interest of either Lessor or Lessee may be assigned, devised or otherwise transferred in whole or in part by area and/or by depth or zone, and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall extend to their respective heirs, devisees, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. No change in Lessor's ownership shall have the effect of reducing the rights or enlarging the obligations of Lessee hereunder, and no change in ownership shall be binding on Lessee until sixty days after Lessee has been furnished the original or duly authenticated copies of the documents establishing such change of ownership to the satisfaction of Lessee or until Lessor has satisfied the notification requirements contained in Lessee's usual form of division order. In the event of the death of any person entitled to shut-in royalties hereunder, Lessee may pay or tender such shut-in royalties to the credit of decedent or decedent's estate at the address designated above. If at any time two or more persons are entitled to shut-in royalties hereunder, Lessee may pay or tender such shut-in royalties to such persons, either jointly, or separately in proportion to the interests which each owns. If Lessee transfers its interest hereunder in whole or in part, Lessee shall be relieved of all obligations hereafter existing with respect to the transferred interests, and failure of the transferee to satisfy such obligations with respect to the transferred interests, shall not effect the rights of Lessee with respect to any interests not so transferred. If Lessee transfers a full or undivided interest in all or any portion of the area covered by this lease, the obligation to pay or tender shut-in royalties hereunder shall be divided between Lessee and the transferee in proportion to the net acreage interest in this lease then held by each. 9. Release of Lease. Lessee may, at any time and from time to time deliver to Lessor or file of record a written release of this lease as to a full or undivided interest in all or any portion of the area covered by this lease or any depths or zones thereunder, and shall thereupon be relieved of all obligations thereafter arising with respect to the interest so released. If Lessee releases less than all of the interest or area covered hereby, Lessee's obligation to pay or tender shut-in royalties shall be proportionately reduced in accordance with the net acreage interest retained hereunder. 10.  Ancillary Rights. In exploring for developing, producing and marketing all oil, gas and other substances covered hereby on the leased premises or lands pooled or unitized therewith, in primary and/or enhanced recovery, Lessee shall have the right of ingress and egress along with the right to conduct such operations on the leased premises as may be reasonably necessary for such purposes, including but not limited to geophysical operations, the drilling of wells, and the construction and use of roads, canals, pipelines, tanks, water wells, disposal wells, injection wells, pits, electric and telephone lines, power stations, and other facilities deemed necessary by Lessee to discover, produce, store, treat and/or transport production. Lessee may use in such operations, free of cost, any oil, gas, water and/or other substances produced on the leased premises, except water from Lessor's well or ponds, in exploring, developing, producing or marketing from the leased premises or lands pooled or unitized therewith, the ancillary rights granted herein shall apply (a) to the entire leased premises described in Paragraph 1 above, notwithstanding any partial releases or other partial termination of this lease, and (b) to any other lands in which Lessor now or hereafter has authority to grant such rights in the vicinity of the leased premises or lands pooled therewith. When requested by Lessor in writing, Lessee shall bury its pipelines below ordinary plow depth on cultivated lands. No well shall be located less than 200 feet from any house or bam now on the leased premises or other Lands of Lessor used by Lessee hereunder, without Lessor's consent, and Lessee shall pay for damage caused by its operations to buildings and other improvements now on the leased premises or such other lands, and to commercial timber and growing crops thereon. Lessee shall have the right at any time to remove its fixtures, equipment and materials, including well casing, from the leased premises or such other lands during the term of this lease or within a reasonable time thereafter. 11.  Regulanoti and Delay. Lessee's obligations under this lease, whether express or implied, shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders of any governmental authority having jurisdiction, including restrictions on the drilling and production of wells, and regulation of the price or transportation of oil, gas and other substances covered hereby. When drilling, reworking, production or other operations are prevented or delayed by such laws, rules, regulations or orders, or by inability to obtain necessary permits, equipment, services, material, water, electricity, fuel, access or easements, or by fire, flood, adverse weather conditions, war, sabotage, rebellion, insurrection, riot, strike or labor disputes, or by inability to obtain a satisfactory market for production or failure of purchasers or carriers to take or transport such production, or by any other cause not reasonably within Lessee's control, this lease shall not terminate because of such prevention or delay, and, at Lessee's option, the period of such prevention or delay shall be added to the term hereof. Lessee shall not be liable for breach of any provisions or implied covenants of this lease when drilling, production or other operations are so prevented or delayed. 12. Breach or Default. No litigation shall be initiated by Lessor for damages, forfeiture or cancellation with respect to any breach or default by Lessee hereunder, for a period of at least 90 days after Lessor has given Lessee written notice fully describing the breach or default, and then only if Lessee fails to remedy the breach or default within such period. In the event the matter is litigated and there is a final judicial determination that a breach or default has occurred, this lease shall not be forfeited or cancelled in whole or in part unless Lessee is given a reasonable time after said judicial determination to remedy the breach or default and Lessee fails to do so. 13.  Warranty of Title. Lessor hereby warrants and agrees to defend title conveyed to Lessee hereunder, through and under Lessor but not otherwise, and agrees that Lessee at Lessee’s option may pay and discharge any taxes, mortgages or liens existing, levied or assessed on or against the leased premises. If Lessee exercises such option, Lessee shall be subrogated to the rights of the party to whom payment is made, and, in addition to its other rights, may reimburse itself out of any royalties or shut-in royalties otherwise payable to Lessor hereunder. In the event Lessee is made aware of any claim inconsistent with Lessor's title, Lessee may suspend the payment of royalties and shut-in royalties hereunder, without interest, until Lessee has been furnished satisfactory evidence that such claim has been resolved. 14. Governmental Waiver. Lessor hereby agrees that, in the event Lessee deems it necessary to seek a variance waiver or other relief from any laws, rules, regulations, or orders (which for purposes of the paragraph shall include any ordinance) or other such authority exercised by (i) the City of Arlington, including, but not limited to the well setback distance for gas drilling and production, or (ii) by any other governmental entity or authority having jurisdiction then Lessor shall engage in reasonable acts and execute and deliver such instruments and documents Lessee deems necessary or convenient in seeking such relief. In the event Lessee is required by such authority to acquire Lessor’s consent as a prerequisite to obtain such variance, waiver or other relief. Lessor grants to Lessee and agrees that Lessee’s leasehold estate acquired hereunder includes the right to utilize this lease as Lessor’s consent and ratification of any subsequent variance, waiver or other relief Lessee seeks, without the necessity of Lessee obtaining any additional or subsequent consent/s from Lessor. Lessor furthermore agrees not to execute documents or instruments or engage in acts that would diminish or adversely affect the relief Lessee is seeking. 15. Counter Offer, In the event that Lessor, during the primary term of this lease, receives a bona fide offer which Lessor is willing to accept from any party offering to purchase from Lessor’s lease covering any or all of the substances covered by this lease and covering all or a portion of the land described herein with the lease becoming effective upon expiration of this lease. Lessor hereby agrees to notify Lessee in writing of said offer immediately, including in the notice the name and address of the offeror and all other pertinent terms and conditions of the offer.
