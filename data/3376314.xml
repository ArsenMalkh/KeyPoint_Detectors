		<Aux:document_text xml:lang="en-US">In 2003, the Supreme Court of Switzerland ruled that Swiss officials could provide Bojić's bank records to prosecutors in Serbia. In February 2005, by which time Bojić was no longer a parliamentarian, the Belgrade district prosecutor's office charged him with abuse of office. The charges were later withdrawn due to a lack of evidence. A new investigation was launched in 2011, and in April 2012 he was convicted of misusing his position at the Dedinje institute to embezzle more than 200,000 German marks. This decision was later overturned on appeal, and he was acquitted in a retrial. In 2012, Bojić, acting in his capacity as a medical official, visited Radical Party leader Vojislav Šešelj at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague and concluded that Šešelj's life was in danger due to health problems he was experiencing in captivity. In 2014, he urged that Šešelj be returned to Belgrade for treatment. After Šešelj was permitted to return to Belgrade on medical grounds, Bojić argued that forcing him to return to The Hague to face charges would be an act of murder, given Šešelj's ongoing cancer treatments. The matter ultimately became moot. The tribunal initially acquitted Šešelj in absentia of the charges against him. This acquittal was subsequently overturned and Šešelj was given a ten-year sentence for crimes against humanity, but he was not required to serve any of the sentence as he had already spent eleven years in pre-trial custody</Aux:document_text>
