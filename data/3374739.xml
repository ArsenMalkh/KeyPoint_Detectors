		<Aux:document_text xml:lang="en-US">Ms. Stewart (Canada) said that her Government had recently taken several major steps to address a regrettable chapter in Canadian history: that of Indian Residential Schools. That system, which had existed for over a century, had separated more than 150,000 aboriginal children from their homes and communities. The Government had offered a formal apology to former students of those schools, distributed more than 1.4 billion Canadian dollars to 64,000 victims of the practice and set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. There were two main types of land claims processes in Canada: comprehensive claims, which involved ancestral lands rights not dealt with by treaties or other legal instruments, and specific claims, which were not necessarily land-related and dealt with Canada’s obligations under historic treaties or the way in which it had managed First Nations’ assets. In 2008 the Canadian Government had adopted legislation creating the Specific Claims Tribunal, an initiative which gave indigenous peoples the option of bringing their claims before an independent tribunal. Her Government recognized that lands and resources played a significant role in the subsistence and the economic self-sufficiency of aboriginal peoples and were also of great cultural and spiritual importance. Aboriginal communities, governments and private companies had gained considerable experience in negotiating working arrangements aimed at ensuring responsible corporate behaviour and aboriginal participation in and benefit from the development of natural resources</Aux:document_text>
