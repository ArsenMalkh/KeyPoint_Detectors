Lessee is hereby granted the right, at its option, to pool or unitize any land covered by this lease with any other land covered by this lease, and/or witfi any other land, lease, or leases, as to any or ad minerals or horizons, so as to establish unite containing not mere thenSOsurfece acres, plus 10% acreage tolerance; provided, however, unite may be established as to any one or more horizons, or existing units may be enforced as to any one or more horizons, so as to contain not more than640 surface acres plus 10% acreage tolerance, if timited to one or more of the following: (1) gas, other than casinghead gas, (2) Squid hydrocarbons (condensate) which are not Squids in the subsurface reservoir, (3) minerals produced from wels classified as gas wefts by the conservation agency having jurisdiction. If larger units than any of those herein permitted, either at the time established, or alter enlargement, are permitted or required under any governmental rule or order, for the driftng or operation of a well at a regular location, or for obtaining maximum allowable from any well to be drifted, drifting, or already drilled, any such unit may be established or enlarged to conform to the size permitted or required by such governmental order or rule. Lessee shall exercise said option as to each desired unit by executing an instrument identifying such unit and fling it for record in the public office in which this lease is recorded. Such unit shall become effective as of the date provided for in sad instrument or nstruments but if said instrument or instruments make no such provision, then such unit shall become effective on the date such instrument or instruments are so filed of record.

There shall be allocated to the land covered by this tease within each siren unit (or to each separate tract within the unit if this tease covers separate tracts within the unit) that proportion of the total production of unitized minerals from the unit, after deducting any used in tease or unit operations, which the number of surface acres in such tend (or in each such separate tract) covered by this tease within the unit bears to the total number of surface acres in the unit, and the production so allocated shall be considered for al purposes, inducting payment or delivery of royalty, overriding royalty and any other payments out of production, to be the entire production of unitized minerals from the tend to which allocated in the same manner as though produced therefrom under the terms of this tease. The owner of the reversionary estate of any term royalty or mineral estate agrees that the accrual of royalties pursuant to this paragraph or of shut-in royalties from a well on the unft shafi satisfy any limitation of term requiring production of ofl or gas. The formation of any unit hereunder which includes land not covered by this lease shall not have the effect of exchanging or transferring any interest under this lease (including, wtttoift limitation, any shut-in royalty which may become payable under this lease) between parties owning interests in land covered by this tease and parties owning interests tn land not covered by this tease. Neither shal it impair the right of Lessee to retease as provided in paragraph 5 hereof, except that Lessee may not so release as to lands wthin a unit white there are operations thereon for unitized minerals unless al pooled leases are released as to lands within the unit At any time while this tease is in force Lessee may dissolve any unit established hereunder by filing for record in the pubic office where this tease is recorded a declaration to that effect, if at that time there is no unitized minerals being produced from such unit Any unit formed may be amended, reformed, reduced or enlarged by Lessee at its election at any time and from time to time after the original forming thereof by fifing an appropriate instrument of record in the public office in which the pooled acreage is located. Subject to the provisions of this paragraph 4, a unit once established hereunder shal reman in force so long as any lease subject thereto shal remain in force. If this lease now or hereafter covers separate tracts, no pooling or unitization of royalty interests as between any such separate tracts is intended or shall be implied or result merely from the inclusion of such separate tracts within this tease but Lessee shal nevertheless have the right to pool or unitize as provided in this paragraph 4 with consequent alocation of production as herein provided. As used in this paragraph 4, the words "separate tract" mean any tract wth royalty ownership differing, now or hereafter, either as to parties or amounts, from that as to any other part of the leased premises. 5. Lessee may at any time and from time to time execute and deliver to Lessor or file for record a release or releases of this lease as to any part or all of said land or of any mineral or horizon thereunder, and thereby be relieved of al obligations, as to the released acreage or interest. 6.

Lessee shall have the right at any time to remove al machinery and fixtures placed on said land, including the right to draw and remove casing. No wel shall be drived nearer than 200 feet to the house or bam naw on said land without the consent of the Lessor. Lessee shal pay for damages caused by its operations to growing crops and timber on said land. 8. The rights and estate of any party hereto may be assigned from time to time in whole or in part and as to any mineral or horizon. All of the covenants, obfigations, and considerations of this tease shal extend to and be binding upon the parties hereto, their heirs, successors, assigns, and successive assigns. No change or division in the ownership of said land, royalties, or other moneys, or any part thereof, howsoever effected, shal increase the obligations or diminish the rights of Lessee, including, but not limited to, the location and drilling of wells and the measurement of production. Notwithstanding any other actual or constructive knowledge or notice thereof of or to Lessee, its successors or assigns, no change or division in the ownership of said laid or of the royalties, or other moneys, or the right to receive the same, howsoever effected, shall be binding upon the then record owner of this tease until sixty (60) days after there has been furnished to such record owner at his or its principal place of business by Lessor or Lessor’s heirs, successors, or assigns, notice of such change or division, supported by either originals or duly certified copies of the instruments which have been properly filed for record and which evidence such change or division, and of such court records and proceedings, transcripts, or other documents as shal be necessary in the opinion of such record owner to establish the validity of such change or division. If any such change in ownership occurs by reason of the death of the owner, Lessee may, nevertheless pay or tender such royalties, or other moneys, or part thereof, to the credit of the decedent in a depository bank provided for above. 9. In the event Lessor considers that Lessee has not complied with all its obligations hereunder, both express aid implied. Lessor shall notify Lessee in writing, setting out specfficafly in what respects Lessee has breached this contract. Lessee shall then have sixty (60) days after receipt of said notice within which to meet or commence to meet all or any part off the breaches alleged by Lessor. The service of said notice shall be precedent to the bringing of any action by Lessor on said tease for any cause, and no such action shall be brought until the lapse of sixty (60) days after service of such notice on Lessee. Neither the service of said notice nor the doing of any acts by Lessee aimed to meet all or any of the afieged breaches shal be deemed an admission or presumption that Lessee has foiled to perform al its obligations hereunder. If this lease is canceled for any cause, It shal nevertheless remain in force and effect as to (1) sufficient acreage around each wel as to which there are operations to constitute a offing or maximum allowable unit under applicable governmental regulations, (out in no event less that forty acres), such acreage to be designated by Lessee as neariy as practicable in the form of a square centered at the wel, or in such shape as then existing spacing rules require; and (2) any part of said tend included in a pooled unit on which there are operations. Lessee shall also have such easements on said land as are necessary to operations on the acreage so retained and shal not be required to move or remove any existing surface fedities necessary or convenient for current operations. 10. Lessor hereby warrants and agrees to defend title to said land against the damns of al persons whomsoever. Lessor's rights and interests hereunder shal be charged primarily with any mortgages, taxes or other lens, or interest and other charges on said land, but Lessor agrees that Lessee shal have the right at any time to pay or reduce same for Lessor, either before or after maturity, and be subrogated to the rights of the holder thereof and to deduct amounts so paid from royalties or other payments payable or which may become payable to Lessor and/or assigns under this lease. If this lease covers a less interest in the oil, gas, sulphur, or other minerals in a* or any part of said land than the entire and undivided fee simple estate (whether Lessor's interest is herein specified or not), or no interest therein, then the royalties and other moneys accruing from any part as to which this tease covers less than such fufl interest shafl be paid only in the proportion which the interest therein, if any, covered by this lease, bears to the whole and undhrided fee simple estate therein. Al royalty interest covered by this tease (whether or not owned by Lessor) shall be paid out of the royalty herein provided. This lease shall be binding upon each party who executes it without regard to whether it is executed by al those named herein as Lessor. 11. If, while this tease is in fcxce, at, or after the expiration of the primary term hereof, it is not being continued in force by reason of the shuMn wel provisions of paragraph 3 hereof, and Lessee is not conducting operations on said land by reason of (1) any law, older, rule or regulation, (whether or not subsequently determined to be invalid) or (2) any other cause, whether simiar or dissimilar, (except financial) beyond the reasonable control off Lessee, the primary term hereof shall be extended unffi the first anniversary date hereof occurring ninety (90) or more days following the removal of such delaying cause, and this tease may be extended thereafter by operations as if such delay had not occurred. 12. Lessor agrees that this tease covers and includes any and aH of Lessor's rights in and to any existing wel(s) and/or weUbore(s) on said land, other than existing water weds, and for aH purposes of this lease the re-entry and use by Lessee of any eadsting well and/or wellbore shal be deemed the same as the drifting of a new wel. 13. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this tease, at the option of Lessee, which may be exercised by Lessee giving notice to Lessor, a well which has been drilled and Lessee intends to frac shall be deemed a well capable of producing in paying quantities and the date such well is shut-in shall be when the drilling operations are completed. 14. As a result of land development in the vicinity of said land, governmental rules or ordinances regarding well sites, and/or surface restrictions as may be set forth in this lease and/or other teases in the vicinity, surface locations for well sites in the vicinity may be limited and Lessee may encounter difficulty securing surface locations) for drilling, reworking or other operations. Therefore, since drilling, reworking or other operations are either restricted or net allowed on said land or other leases in the vicinity, it is agreed that any such operations conducted at a surface location off of said land or off of lands with which said land are pooled in accordance with this lease, provided that such operations are associated with a directional well for the purpose of drilling, reworking, producing or other operations under said land or lands pooled therewith, shall for purposes of this lease be deemed operations conducted on said land.
