		<Aux:document_text xml:lang="en-US">Unlike his predecessor, Smith claimed authority over Scotland, and asserted that no priest sent to England should exercise their faculties unless approved by him. He created new vicars and archdeacons, and issued a regulation that none of the regular clergy (i.e., priests belonging to religious orders) could hear confessions unless he was approved by Smith. His order that the laity should receive his ministers and officials put them in jeopardy of arrest. Smith had also managed to antagonize the Catholic nobles by arbitrarily assigning confessors, and threatening to make Lord Morley return to live with his wife. The disputes had become so contentious that his residence in London became known and in 1628 a warrant was issued for his arrest. In March 1629, a reward of 100₤ was offered for his capture. Smith stayed with the French ambassador, the Marquess de Chateauneuf. The king was aware of this. At a dinner during Lent, King Charles encouraged his pregnant wife to eat some meat, which the queen was reluctant to do without ecclesiastical permission. Whereupon the king turned to the ambassador and requested that he quickly send a servant to obtain the said permission, adding that he knew full well he would find the bishop there.</Aux:document_text>
