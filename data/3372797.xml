		<Aux:document_text xml:lang="en-US">These were unanswerable questions. For accommodation, I had only my wretched little hut. There wasn't anyone to look after the children during my long rounds in the bush. As for money, there was literally nothing in the till. What I'd brought back from my holiday in Europe had gone to help those hit by the terrible cyclone Dany.  When I was thinking about all this a few days later there was a knock on the door; it was the postman. He gave me an unsigned letter saying that 300,000 Malagasy francs were being sent "to help unfortunate children". What a relief! It was more than a "sign", it was an answer from Providence, a smile from heaven.  But that was not all; there was another knock on the door. It was a little old woman carrying a little boy of 7 or 8. The child had club feet, completely twisted round. "Look at this child", she said, "He's my grandson. Because of his feet no one loves him. I'm the only one who loves him. Take him as your son and then I can go and join my ancestors”. I took the child in my arms. The old woman died sometime later, at peace.</Aux:document_text>
