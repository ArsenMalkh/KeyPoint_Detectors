		<Aux:document_text xml:lang="en-US">When Grete spent her summer holidays in Salzburg in 1913, she had a short liaison with Erhard Buschbeck. In the winter of 1913–1914 she was ready to start her concert career, but she became pregnant and had a miscarriage in March 1914. Georg travelled to Berlin to support her and later tried to get her to Salzburg. Grete however stayed in Berlin. The two never saw each other again. Georg went into the army and died in Kraków on 3 November 1914. The inheritance Georg bequeathed Grete 20.000 Austrian Crowns, a large sum of money at that time. He had received this money from his art czar Ludwig (von) Ficker, who in his turn had received it from Ludwig Wittgenstein to support promising artists. Grete and her husband travelled to Innsbruck to secure the inheritance, but eventually the family took the money in, and Grete was sent to the private clinic of the Kreuzschwestern (Sisters of the Cross) in Innsbruck. She stayed there for two weeks and then returned to Berlin in March 1915. She was not happy there; the marriage was under pressure. During the Summer of 1915 she amused herself in Innsbruck with Georg's former colleagues of the '’Der Brenner'’ magazine. From October 1915 onwards she stayed with the family in Salzburg again.</Aux:document_text>
