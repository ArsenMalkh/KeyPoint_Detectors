		<Aux:document_text xml:lang="en-US">In 1957 the Syrian poet Adunis and the Lebanese poet Yusuf al-Khal began publishing a new magazine, Majallat Shi'r ('Poetry Magazine') in Beirut. Sayyab began writing for it and this brought him into contact with other writers in their circle, including Ounsi el-Hajj, and Khalil Hawi. In 1960 Sayyab visited Beirut to publish a collection of his poetry, and won first prize (1000 Lebanese pounds) in a competition run by Majallat Shi'r for his collection Onshudat al-Matar (The Rain Song) which was later to become among his most widely acclaimed works. Illness and death Returning to Iraq, Sayyab was given a job at the Iraqi Ports Authority and moved to Basra. However he was arrested again on 4 February 1961 and held until 20 February. By this time his political stance and rising literary fame had brought him to the attention of the Congress for Cultural Freedom which invited him to attend a conference entitled 'The Arab Writer and the Modern World’ in Rome. However in the same year, his health began to deteriorate. In April 1962 he was admitted to the American University Hospital in Beirut, and his literary friends, including Yusuf Al-Khal, paid his fees. On his return to Basra in September 1962 the Congress for Cultural Freedom provided ongoing financial assistance to him and arranged for him to go to London to seek medical advice</Aux:document_text>
