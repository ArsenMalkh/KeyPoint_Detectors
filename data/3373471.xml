The song, featuring Justin Timberlake and vocals from Timbaland, who also produced the song along with Danja, is about a man who is tired of using technology, and peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100. Internationally, the song peaked within the top ten of the charts in many countries, including Australia, Denmark and the United Kingdom. The song has since been covered by Milow, a Belgian singer-songwriter whose version was successful in a number of countries, including Belgium, Spain, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. The song was also covered by Skyla, a British singer-songwriter whose version was popular in the dance genre and Katerine Avgoustakis, another Belgian singer, whose version was very successful in various Central and Eastern European countries, particularly in Poland.</Aux:document_text>
