		<Aux:document_text xml:lang="en-US">COMMERCIAL-INDUSTRIAL POWER CONTRACT THIS CONTRACT is made this 12th day of January 2009 by and between Nashville State Tech Community College, (herein referred to as Member) doing business in the State of Tennessee and Meriwether Lewis Electric Cooperative, a Tennessee corporation with its principal office located in Centerville, Tennessee (herein referred to as Cooperative). RECITALS WHEREAS, Member has applied for commercial electric service from Cooperative for the operation of its facility in Waverly of Humphreys County, Tennessee. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows: 1.  Cooperative shall supply, and Member shall take and pay for, all the electricity required for the operation of a Community College located at 695 Holly Lane and designated by Cooperative as account number 068-0788-003 and station number 3044101510 in accordance with the terms hereof and the Rules, Regulations, and Bylaws of Cooperative as they now exist or as may be hereafter adopted, Member acknowledging copies of the current version have been furnished to Member. 2.  The maximum demand (also referred to as “contract demand”), or amount of electric power, which Member shall be entitled to receive under this contract, shall not exceed 225 kW (kilowatts). Member shall not exceed such maximum demand except by agreement of Cooperative and revision of this contract, but nothing herein contained shall be construed to relieve Member of the obligation to pay for such amounts of electric power as Member may actually take. Exceeding maximum demand may require the computation of a new minimum bill (described in section 5, below). Member acknowledges that it has no ownership right of any unused power. All unused power shall remain the sole property of Cooperative and is not subject to sale or alienation by Member. 3.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the electric power and energy sold hereunder shall be purchased and paid for by Member according to the provisions of Cooperative's standard schedule of rates and charges applicable to general power customers, as modified from time to time by agreement between Cooperative and the Tennessee Valley Authority (herein TVA). Member acknowledges receipt simultaneously herewith of a copy of the current rate schedule. Cooperative will furnish Member a copy of any changes to the rate schedule implemented hereafter upon request of Member. 4.  As defined under the “Determination of Demand” section of Cooperative’s General Power Rate Schedule, Member shall maintain an acceptable power factor level (currently 85%, but subject to change under future rate schedule adjustments) or pay the excess charge for low power factor. Member shall use power in such a manner as will not cause objectionable fluctuations or other electrical disturbances on Cooperative's system. Member shall abide by Cooperative’s motor start policy of which Member acknowledges receipt prior to the execution of this contract. 5.  Member shall pay as a minimum the amounts determined under the provisions of the current rate schedule entitled “Minimum Bill,” but in no case shall Member’s monthly minimum bill be less than $754.40. This monthly minimum may change with future rate schedule adjustments. 6.  Electricity furnished hereunder shall be in the following form: three (3) phase, approximately 208/120 Volts alternating current at 60 Hz, and a Wye transformer secondary connection. The Point of Delivery for the electricity supplied hereunder shall be at the transformer secondary bushings and shall constitute delivery of electricity for the purpose of this contract. The electricity to be supplied to Member hereunder shall be metered on the low voltage side of the distribution transformers, all of which is constructed, owned, and operated by Cooperative. Cooperative will install only such protective devices as in its opinion are necessary for the protection of its transformers and/or the distribution lines supplying power to such transformers. Member shall provide protection for his equipment against damage from external conditions such as single phasing, lightning, etc. Member shall furnish Cooperative without charge or fee a suitable transformer site and right-of-way thereto over the property of Member for the period hereof. The transformers, distribution facilities, and other related equipment installed thereon shal l be the personal property of Cooperative and shall not be deemed a fixture attached to the land. Cooperative’s agents and employees shall have free right of ingress and egress on said site and right-of-way. Where a pad and/or fence are required, the same shall be furnished at the expense of Member. 7.  The term of this contract shall be a minimum of (5) five years and shall begin on the date hereof or the date of first delivery of electricity hereunder, whichever first occurs. After five years, Member may terminate this contract on thirty (30) days written notice of such termination. Any obligation of member accruing prior thereto shall remain the obligation of Member to perform in accordance with the terms hereof. This contract may be terminated by Cooperative in accordance with its Rules, Regulations and By-laws or on the failure of Member to observe and perform any provision hereof. 8.  Cooperative will use reasonable diligence to provide a regular and uninterrupted supply of power, but in case the supply of power should be interrupted or curtailed for any cause, Cooperative shall not be liable for damage resulting there from. In the event of a general power shortage in the area served by TVA, Member shall allow Cooperative to curtail the amount of power delivered under this contract to the degree that Cooperative and other utilities in the service area are requested or required by TVA or any competent regulatory body to curtail service to commercial businesses or industries of like nature to that of Member and to which existing continuous service began at the same or a later date and which use the same or greater amounts of power. 9.  Member shall continuously maintain its membership with Cooperative and per Cooperative Policy 4.7 is not required to maintain a security deposit. 10. This contract shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the heirs, legal representatives, successors, and assigns of the parties hereto, but is not assignable by Member without written consent of Cooperative. 11. This contract is negotiated and entered into at Centerville of Hickman County, Tennessee and shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Tennessee. Member submits itself to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Tennessee in the event any suit or action is brought in connection with this contract. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties execute this contract by their duly authorized officers or agents in triplicate as of the day and date first above written. Proof of any one thereof shall be sufficient without proof of any other. Tennessee Board of Regents for Nashville State Tech Community College              Meriwether Lewis Electric Cooperative By: Printed Name: Title: Date: By: Printed Name: Hal Womble Title: President &amp; CEO Date: Meriwether Lewis Electric Cooperative Retail Rate Schedule Summary (Incl Environmental Adj &amp; FCA) Effective January 1,2009 </Aux:document_text>
